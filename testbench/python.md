# Python for Beginners

Python is an interpreted, dynamically typed language known for its
readability and simplicity. It is widely used in web development
(Django, Flask), scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy), and machine
learning (TensorFlow, PyTorch). Thanks to its vast ecosystem, Python
enables rapid prototyping and full‑scale application development. In
recent years, it has become the standard for data analysis and AI
research.
