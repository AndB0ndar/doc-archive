# PostgreSQL and pgvector

PostgreSQL is one of the most popular open‑source relational databases.
It supports extensions such as pg_trgm for fuzzy search and pgvector for
vector embeddings. pgvector allows storing fixed‑size vectors and
performing fast nearest‑neighbor search using cosine distance or L2.
This makes PostgreSQL a solid foundation for semantic search and
recommendation systems without needing an external vector database.
