# Introduction to Go

Go (or Golang) is a compiled, concurrent programming language developed
at Google. It combines simple syntax with high performance, making it
ideal for building web services and microservices. The standard library
includes powerful packages for HTTP, JSON, and concurrency (goroutines
and channels). Major projects like Docker and Kubernetes are written in
Go.
